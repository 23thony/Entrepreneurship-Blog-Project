        <h2>What is an Entrepreneur?</h2>
        <p>One who creates a new business in the face of risk and uncertainty for the purpose of achieving profit and growth by identifying opportunities and assembling the necessary resources to capitalize on them.</p>

        <h2>The World of the Entrepreneur</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) study reports:
                <ul>
                    <li>Men are twice as likely to start a business as women.</li>
                    <li>Most entrepreneurs turns to family members and friends for capital.</li>
                    <li>Entrepreneurs are most likely to launch businesses when they are between the ages 35 and 44.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Entrepreneurship?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The word entrepreneurship is the act of being an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur does entrepreneurship and  acts entrepreneurially.</li>
            <li>Entrepreneurship is important in society. Entrepreneurs create businesses, which provide jobs and income to people in a local community or around the world. Businesses solve small and large problem, provide much-needed goods and services, and pay taxed that help the government function.</li>
            <li>Entrepreneurship also enables individuals to exercise their freedom to pursue opportunities and a life of their choosing.</li>
            <li>There are many reason why someone would want to run and take on the risk of operating a business. The most common reasons include being your own boss, setting your own work schedule, being part of something that you own, having control of your destiny, and perhaps even the possibility of generating enough wealth to gain financial freedom. There are many other reasons as well.</li>
            <li>There are many challenges associated with being an entrepreneur. For example, since you own the business, if it does not do as well as you expect, you are still responsible  for it. You may have to work many hours each day managing and dealing with problems that arise. You may not even make enough money to pay yourself a salary. If your business is not successful, you may lose all the money you invested in it as well as some of your personal assets</li>
